Welcome to the **SQL Queries Repository**! This repository contains a collection of SQL queries for various use cases, including data analysis, database management, and reporting.

## 📌 About
This repository includes SQL queries that demonstrate:
- Data retrieval using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY`
- Joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`)
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
- Data modification (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
- Indexing and performance optimization
- Stored procedures and functions
